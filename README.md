### portfolio
This repository houses my files used to create my portfolio website. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic website.
I also used a form to send myself an email when someone wants to contact me to work on a project.
this portfolio at the moment is a one page website. It also houses a modal to have a picture of me and the programming languages that I am well versed in.
